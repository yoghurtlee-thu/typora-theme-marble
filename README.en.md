<h1 align="center">Typora Theme - Marble</h1>
<p align="center">A minimalist and soft Typora theme</p>

</div>

## Introduction

I've always been a fan of Typora's [Lapis theme](https://github.com/YiNNx/typora-theme-lapis). So, after I decided to modify the Lapis CSS file to use my favorite font, LxgwWenKai, I decided to create a new theme.

I don't know CSS (yes, you heard it right, I don't know CSS at all), so the theme CSS file is basically a modification of Lapis. I prefer natural color schemes, so I named this theme Marble, inspired by Lapis.

## Preview

## Features

### Fonts and Colors

The Marble theme supports English and Simplified Chinese. The main font for Chinese is [LxgwWenKai](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai), and for English, it's [Cantarell](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell).

The Marble theme uses a natural and soft color scheme. The background color is marble, the text color is dark gray, and the block element background color is a slightly darker gray.

### Code Blocks

The code font is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). The code block color scheme is mainly based on the Lapis theme, with modifications using colors of various minerals such as rose gypsum, lapis lazuli, sapphire, chalk, pyrite, and turquoise.

## Contribution

This theme was initially for personal use, and the style was adjusted based on my personal preferences. The initial development of this theme was based on Windows 11 23H2, and subsequent maintenance was based on macOS Sonoma. so there may be unknown style issues on other systems.
